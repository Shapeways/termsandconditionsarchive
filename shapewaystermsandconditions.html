<h3>Shapeways Services</h3>
<p>The Shapeways Services are made up of different services provided through the Website. One of our Services enables you to upload a 3D file to our Website and view it in 3D.</p>

<p>If you want to turn your 3D model into reality, you can place an order with us to have it manufactured. At a charge of a service price and price for the substance used for the model, we manufacture the model for you (i.e., print it with 3D printing technology) in our materials and ship it to you. You can also order models designed by other Shapeways members: Shapeways allows you to browse the Website for models in our Gallery, to rate these models and to place an order for the manufacturing of an available model. </p><p>Further, Shapeways offers other services and community features through the Website including a forum, a blog, tutorials etc. where you can get in touch with other users or share your experiences.</p>

<h3>Ordering</h3>
<p><strong>1) Placing an order</strong> To order the model you designed or another model you found on our Website, you select the model and click the order button. Then you can select the quantity of the model you order and the material you want the model to be made of.  As the next step, we ask you to provide us with information we need for the delivery of the model. Finally you will be redirected to our payment provider&rsquo;s website to initiate your payment. Please be informed that the language to be used during the whole ordering process is English.</p>

<p><strong>2) Unacceptable orders, cancellation of orders by us</strong> If a model is available through our Website (in the &ldquo;Gallery&rdquo; or &ldquo;My Designs&rdquo; section), the basic assumption is that it can be produced. There are however technical or other reasons why Shapeways may not accept or cancel your order during the entire ordering process, even after our acceptance of your order. Such reasons can be for example but not limited to the unfeasibility of the model, the infringing feature of your model (see our <a href="/legal/content_policy">Notice Take Down Procedure</a>) the destination of the delivery you indicated in your order etc. In case we cancel your partial or entire order we will contact you via email and at Shapeways discretion will issue you store credit or a full refund for the cancelled item(s).</p>

<p><strong>3) Prices in the Gallery</strong> The prices displayed in the Gallery part of the Website are only indications and are valid only for the moment that they are displayed. Shapeways reserves the right to change its prices in the Gallery without prior notice. Such change however will have no effect on orders completed before the posting of a new price on the Gallery. We do our best to prevent errors in the pricing. However, should an error occur, we are not bound by our offer and may cancel the order. Any monies paid related to that order will be refunded to you.</p>

<p><strong>4) Payment and price</strong> The amount indicated on the ordering page includes the fee for the Service (such as printing and packing the model) and the price for the materials used to produce the model.

<p><strong>7) Shipping</strong> Your order will be delivered to your shipping address. We deliver to multiple countries. You can only select those countries as your shipping address during the ordering process.

Title and risk of loss is transferred to you upon transfer of the goods from Shapeways to the shipment carrier (FOB Shipping Point, EX Works). </p>

<p><strong id="cancellation-info">8) Cancellation of your order, return of models</strong>Due to the personalized feature of our Services (i.e. the model is supplied by us based on your specifications), you can not cancel your order after it goes into production. Additionally, we are not able to refund purchases of a <strong>"Gift Card"</strong> or a <strong>"Material Sample Kit Basic (w/free Gift card)"</strong> at any point. Orders that contain non-refundable items are still cancelable, however note that refund or cancellation will not apply to items in the order that are non-refundable.</p>
