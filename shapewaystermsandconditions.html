<p>By using the Services, you acknowledge you have read, understood and agree to be bound by these Terms and Conditions and to comply with all applicable laws and regulations. You also certify that any 3D file (“3D Model”) uploaded to the Shapeways Website does not violate any federal law or regulation including those pertaining to firearms, or applicable standards maintained by ISO, ASTM, ASME, or other similarly situated body.

<p id="a-services">1. <strong>Shapeways Services</strong></p>

<p>The Shapeways Services are made up of different services provided through the Website. One of our Services enables you to upload a 3D file to our Website and view it in 3D.</p>

<p>If you want to turn your 3D Model into reality, you can place an order with us and we will manufacture it for you at your direction. At a charge of a service price and price for the substance used for the 3D Model, we manufacture the 3D Model for you (i.e., print it with 3D printing technology) in our materials and ship it to you. You can also order models designed by other Shapeways members: Shapeways allows you to browse the Website for models and to place an order for the manufacturing of an available model. The Powered by Shapeways Embed allows you to order a 3D Model from a 3rd party website.</p>

<p>Further, Shapeways offers other services and community features through the Website including a forum, a blog, tutorials etc. where you can get in touch with other users or share your experiences.</p>

<p id="a-account-terms">2. <strong>Account Terms</strong></p>

<p id="a-ordering">3. <strong>Ordering</strong></p>

<p><strong>(a) Placing an order.</strong> To order the 3D Model you designed or another 3D Model you found through our Services, you select the 3D Model. Then you can select the quantity of the 3D Model you order and, if applicable, the material you want the 3D Model to be made of. As the next step, we ask you to provide us with information we need for the delivery of the 3D Model. Finally you will be prompted for information required to initiate the payment. Depending on the payment method you select you may be redirected to a third party payment provider website. Please be informed that the language to be used during the whole ordering process is English.</p>

<p><strong>(b) Unacceptable orders, cancellation of orders by us.</strong> If a 3D Model is available through our Website, the default assumption is that it can be produced. There are, however, technical or other reasons why Shapeways may not accept or may cancel your order during the entire ordering process, even after our acceptance of your order. Such reasons can be, but are not limited to, the unfeasibility of the model, an infringing feature of your 3D Model (see our <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/legal/content_policy">Content Policy</a>), or the destination of the delivery you indicated in your order. In case we cancel your partial or entire order, we will contact you via email and, except in cases of fraud or other violations of our policies, issue you a full refund for the cancelled item(s).</p>

<p><strong>(c) Prices.</strong> The prices displayed on the Website or Embed are only indications and are valid only for the moment that they are displayed. Shapeways reserves the right to change its prices on the website at any time without prior notice to you. Such change however will have no effect on orders completed before the posting of a new price on the website. We do our best to prevent errors in the pricing. However, should an error occur, we are not bound by our offer and may cancel the order. In the event of an error, any monies paid related to that order will be refunded to you.</p>

<p><strong>(d) Payment and price.</strong> The amount indicated on the ordering page includes the fee for the service (such as printing and packing the model), the price for the materials used to produce the 3D Model, and, if applicable, the markup charged by the designer. The price quoted on the ordering page also includes shipping costs, sales tax (if applicable) but excludes any import duty or taxes (if applicable). The price quoted on the Embed is for the cost of printing the item and any vendor markup. Shapeways offers estimated currency conversions as a courtesy to users.&nbsp; These estimates are not guaranteed and may not reflect actual currency conversation rates.&nbsp; If you pay in a currency that is different from the denominated currency of your payment method (which is probably the case if your bank or credit card account is not denominated in U.S. Dollars or Euros), your payment company (such as your credit or bank card issuer) or third-party payment processor may apply a currency conversion rate or fees to your payment.&nbsp; Please contact your provider for information about these fees.&nbsp; These fees are not controlled by or known to Shapeways.</p>

<p>You can initiate your payment for your order via credit card, PayPal.com, or bank transfer. If you choose to pay using PayPal you will be directed to the PayPal.com website. In case you choose to pay by bank transfer you will receive the payment instructions via email from Shapeways after confirmation of your order.</p>

<p>Shapeways shall not be responsible in any way for the payment process done via the PayPal.com website. Please familiarize yourself with PayPal&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.paypal.com/us/webapps/mpp/ua/useragreement-full">terms of use</a>.</p>

<p>For orders paid for via credit card or PayPal, Shapeways will begin production after authorizing and holding payment.&nbsp; For orders paid for via bank transfer, Shapeways will begin production after the funds arrive in the Shapeways bank account.In the event that the selected payment method fails for any reason, Shapeways reserves the right to process the payment again or require you to provide an alternative method of payment.</p>

<p><strong>(e) Acceptance</strong> After accepting your order we will send you an order confirmation by e-mail to the address associated with your Shapeways Account. The order confirmation will be effective as of the date on which the order confirmation is sent to you. If we cannot accept your order we will contact you by email. You should verify the details in the confirmation email. If there are errors you should contact us as soon as possible by <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/contact/contact-form?email_to=service@shapeways.com">sending an email to customer service</a>.</p>

<p><strong>(f) Order Tracking</strong> Through the Website or &ndash; if you choose so &ndash; via e-mail notifications, you can track the status of your order e.g. accepted order, produced, dispatched, delivered etc.</p>

<p><strong>(g) Shipping</strong> Your order will be delivered to your shipping address. We deliver to multiple countries. You can only select those countries as your shipping address during the ordering process. We will use our commercially reasonable efforts to ship the 3D Model to the shipping address within the delivery time indicated in our confirmation email; nevertheless, depending on your shipping address it may take longer time. Any shipping and delivery dates given by us are only best estimates and we are not liable for any damage or cost caused by delay in shipping or delivery. Title and risk of loss is transferred to you upon transfer of the goods from Shapeways to the shipment carrier (FOB Shipping Point, EX Works).</p>

<p><strong>(h) Cancellation of your order, return of 3D Models.&nbsp; </strong>Due to the personalized nature of our Services (i.e. the 3D Model is supplied by us based on your specifications), you cannot cancel your order after it goes into production. Additionally, except where required by law we are not able to refund purchases of a <strong>&quot;Gift Card&quot;</strong> or a <strong>&quot;Material Sample Kit Basic (w/free Gift card)&quot;</strong> at any point. Orders that contain non-refundable items are still cancelable, however note that refund or cancellation will not apply to items in the order that are non-refundable.</p>

  <p><strong>(i) Content Policy violations.</strong>If we determine that your model violates our Content Policy prior to printing, we will refuse to print the model and issue a refund.  If we determine that your model violates our Content Policy after it has been printed, we will not ship the model and may not issue you a full refund.  </p>

<p id="a-warranty">4. <strong>Warranty; Disclaimer.</strong></p>

<p>Shapeways warrants only that the model manufactured by us will substantially meet the features of the indicated 3D Model within the limitations of the 3D printing technology. If you upload your own 3D Model to the Website or the Embed, you maintain sole legal responsibility for the design specifications and performance of the 3D Model. Shapeways does not give any warranty about the 3D Models themselves and does not guarantee that the 3D Model will be fit for any particular purposes. Please inspect the 3D Model upon receipt immediately. If the 3D Model is faulty when you received it and you believe you are entitled to a replacement in accordance with the warranty above, please <a href="https://www.shapeways.com/contact/contact-form?email_to=service@shapeways.com">contact us</a> within 10 days after receipt of the 3D Model. Such warranty claim can be made only within 10 days after receipt of the model by you. Do not return the 3D Model unless we require you to do so. We reserve the right to condition any replacement or refund on the return of the 3D Model.  We will confirm whether you are entitled to a replacement or refund. We reserve the right to condition your receipt of a replacement or refund on you providing us with photographs that we deem necessary to evaluate your claim.  A model will be ineligible for replacement or refund if the model has been altered or post-processed in any way by you.  Transportation costs in respect of a faulty product will be borne by us. If we do not receive any notice within the provided 10 days we will assume the 3D Model meets your specifications and performance requirements.  Models you have designated as “Print it Anyway” or its equivalent are not eligible for replacement or refund. </p>

<p>We have no special relationship with or fiduciary duty to you. You acknowledge that we have no duty to take any action regarding: (a) which users gain access to the Services; (b) what content you access via the Services; or (c) how you may interpret or use the content.</p>

<p>You release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired content through the Services.
